7.2.2 Mode Pages
Mode pages are used to provide parametric information from the Drive to the Host or from the Host to the Drive.
Table 689 shows mode pages available to Multi-media Drives.
Since MM Drives do not support sub-pages of mode pages, the Sub-Page field of the MODE SELECT (10)
command is ignored by the Drive.
